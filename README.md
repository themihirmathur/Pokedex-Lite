## Overview

Pokedex Lite is an advanced web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It offers a sleek and interactive way to explore the Pok√©mon universe. With a responsive design and several powerful features, this app ensures an engaging experience for users across all devices.

The application leverages the Pok√©API (v2) to fetch Pok√©mon data and allows users to search, paginate, favorite, and view detailed information about their favorite Pok√©mon. It also includes optional features like user authentication and animations for an enhanced user experience.
