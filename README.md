## Overview

`Pokedex-Lite` is an advanced web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It offers a sleek and interactive way to explore the Pok√©mon universe. With a responsive design and several powerful features, this app ensures an engaging experience for users across all devices.

The application leverages the Pok√©API (v2) to fetch Pok√©mon data and allows users to search, paginate, favorite, and view detailed information about their favorite Pok√©mon. It also includes optional features like user authentication and animations for an enhanced user experience.

## Features

### 1. **Data Fetching**
I used the Pok√©API to retrieve a list of Pok√©mon and implemented robust error handling. Loading states were gracefully managed by displaying spinners or error messages when necessary.

### 2. **Listing & Basic UI**
I displayed Pok√©mon in a visually appealing grid format with their names and images. The design was made fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### 3. **Search**
I provided a search bar that allowed users to filter Pok√©mon by name in real time as they typed.

### 4. **Pagination**
Instead of fetching all Pok√©mon at once, I implemented pagination, allowing users to navigate through the Pok√©mon list efficiently with next and previous buttons.

### 5. **Favorites**
I allowed users to mark Pok√©mon as favorites and ensured their choices were persisted using local storage, so favorites remained intact even after refreshing the page.

### 6. **Detail View**
I created a detailed view (accessible via a separate page or modal) where users could explore additional data about a Pok√©mon, such as stats (e.g., HP, attack) and abilities. Users could close the view and return to the main list seamlessly.

### 7. **Build & Deployment**
I provided clear instructions for running the project locally and ensured the app could be easily built for deployment on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

### **Bonus Features**
1. **User Authentication (OAuth)**  
I experimented with a simple login flow using OAuth providers like Google and GitHub to authenticate users.

No one can just log in, it will check for the user details!

2. **Animations**  
I added subtle animations for hover effects, page transitions, and modal interactions to enhance the user experience.

3. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
I experimented with Next.js to enable server-side rendering, ensuring faster initial loads and improved SEO.

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **MongoDB**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/themihirmathur/Pokedex-Lite.git
   cd Pokedex-Lite
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Replace the `.env.example` file with a `.env` file.
   - Update the following values:
     - `MONGO_URI`: URI of your MongoDB instance.
     - `SECRET`: A randomly generated hash for encrypting passwords.

### Running the Application
